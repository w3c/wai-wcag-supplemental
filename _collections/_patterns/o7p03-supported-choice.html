  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need support and explanations for any choices. The advantages or
      disadvantages are clear to me and I understand the effects of the choice I
      might make.
    </p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    When presenting users with actions and selections, clearly explain the
    benefits, risks and consequences of each option. This includes any:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>changes from what the user asked for,</li>
    <li>disadvantages from the standard product or offering,</li>
    <li>features that may be a risk to users wellbeing or finances.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Clearly stating benefits and consequences of each action and selection
    option helps individuals avoid mistakes. This is particularly important when
    the results cannot be easily corrected, lead to safety risks, or may never
    be known.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a user of a travel site is booking a trip to Geneva. They see
    an option at a good time, but this ticket is to a different city. They
    assume the options given are to the location they asked for. They check the
    dates and times, but, because they can only read by spelling out words, they
    do not notice the changed destination. They are taken to a different
    location than their hotel, and the vulnerable user arrives at night in an
    unfamiliar city without accommodation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, a user sees a laptop for sale at a good price. They do
    not see the refurbished word in the long description. The laptop is not
    actually a good price.

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    Whenever you ask the user to make a selection or take an action, consider
    whether there are any implied or hidden results that the user should be
    aware of. Clearly indicate those results within the user interface and
    confirm the user is aware of them.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Clear lists of what is included and what is not included. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          When choosing an airline ticket. Next to each option, there is a clear
          list of what is included.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Warnings about any changes or risks. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          When choosing an airline ticket, if a ticket option is to a different
          destination or there is another unusual action or change that could be
          unwanted or have risks, the user is asked to confirm the change.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Details that are not clear when the user selects an option.
      <ul>
        <li>
          For example: Meal options from an online menu have fun names. The meal
          contents, side items, allergy information and ability to customize
          each option is not visible until two steps later in the process. A
          customer must go several screens down on each item in order to make a
          decision.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Changing items from the original request without warning the user.</li>
    <li>Risks to the user without warnings.</li>
  </ol>
