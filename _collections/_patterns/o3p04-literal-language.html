  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need to understand the meaning of the text. I do not want unexplained,
      implied or ambiguous information because I may misunderstand jokes and
      metaphors.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Use literal and concrete language. When possible, use concrete terms and
    examples that refer to objects or events that you can see, hear or touch.
  </p>
  <p>Do not use metaphors and similes unless you include an explanation.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Many people do not understand non-literal content. For example, an
    autistic person may not understand jokes and similes. Sometimes
    instructions have jokes and similes to make the content friendlier. However,
    this confuses the user who now cannot do her job as needed.
  </p>
  <p>You can explain any non-literal language by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      adding a simple language term in brackets next to any non-literal text
      such as metaphors and similes,
    </li>
    <li>providing a pop up definition, or</li>
    <li>
      using supported markup (such as personalization semantics
      [[personalization-semantics-help-1.0]]).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In non-text media, explain non-literal content as part of the media or
    include it in a separate file or track. See best practices.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>
    Make sure the meaning remains clear when you replace non-literal text with
    literal text. Check this when providing literal text in a popup or other
    alternative.
  </p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    Start by putting clear literal text on headings, labels, navigational
    elements, instructions, error messages, and any content that may affect the
    userâ€™s rights or wellbeing. This will increase the usability in critical
    places without changing your writing style.

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Literal text and concrete language. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are experiencing anxiety disorders before starting take a deep
          breath, tell yourself you can do it and get started. Anxiety can
          include nervousness, fear, dizziness, or shortness of breath.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Non-literal text. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are experiencing cold feet before starting, take a deep breath
          and jump in.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
