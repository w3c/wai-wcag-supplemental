  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need less content without extra options and features as I cannot
      function at all when there is too much cognitive overload.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Support simplification of your content. Often this includes allowing the
    user to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Remove or hide features that most users do not use or that are not
      essential.
    </li>
    <li>Get less text or more simple text.</li>
    <li>
      Select the content format or version that is easiest for them to
      understand, or
    </li>
    <li>Find the extra features when wanted.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    A user who has difficulty reading or using web content can be easily
    overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to simplify
    the page to include the critical information that they need and not spend
    all their energy reading and understanding other content and features. This
    is also true for users who are easily distracted.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting options
    when drafting an email. This makes it too complex for a lot of people. With
    personalization the user can have a simple option with only send and cancel
    options. There is a “to” and subject line but no cc or bcc options. In this
    setting there is a clear heading (write an email) and they have icons that
    the user understands.
  </p>

  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>Note that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Typically, a simple application has 3 to 6 functions.</li>
    <li>Make sure it is easy to get back to the full featured version.</li>
    <li>
      You can meet this design pattern by:
      <ul>
        <li>supporting simplified versions from the browser,</li>
        <li>using of data-simplification on regions and controls,</li>
        <li>
          using other attributes in personalization semantics (see
          [[personalization-semantics-1.0]]),
        </li>
        <li>adding a simplification toolbar, or</li>
        <li>providing an alternative version.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>
    Add <code>data-simplification="critical"</code> on content that is in any
    critical user testing paths.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>A simplified “reading” view that is available and easy to close.</li>
    <li>
      Applications that have 3 large features. Other features are in the footer
      or under a “more” option.
    </li>
    <li>A simplified version of the application is available.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Simplified modes have unnecessary extra content or are not supported.
    </li>
    <li>
      Applications with lots of features and cannot be simplified. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A busy email program has many control bars and features such as
          tagging, group tagging, start a new thread, etc. There is no easy way
          to simplify the page.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
