  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need to understand the language used, including vocabulary, syntax,
      tense, and other aspects of language.
    </p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Use a simple sentence structure.</p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>do not use a double negative to express a positive, and</li>
    <li>do not use clauses inside clauses.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Simple sentence structure benefits many people, including those with
    language impairments, dyslexia, or a memory impairment. Both double
    negatives and nested clauses can be confusing.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, more people will understand “You must get the agency’s approval
    before we can answer your claim”, rather than “No approval of any claims can
    be achieved without the agency’s approval.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Simple language allows more people to understand. For example, a person with
    early stage dementia can manage their own affairs when the language
    is clear and understandable.

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Short text without double negatives. For example: “Write clearly”.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Double negatives that can be replaced by a positive. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Do not write unclearly.</li>
        <li>Time is not unlimited.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      Long sentences with lots of commas and conjunctions. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Usually, clauses will be separated by two commas, one before and one
          after or the word “or”, or the word “and”, so you could replace the
          sentence with a list of options or even more than one paragraph.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
