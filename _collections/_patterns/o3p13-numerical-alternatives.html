  <h5>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Provide alternatives for numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
  <p>
    For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability
    specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have
    significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but often excel
    in other intellectual areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing
    temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However, if
    non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then they are
    able to understand the content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most severe
    being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other people have
    challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes or times.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a user may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find
    it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same length.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, a train schedule has a list of relative times that the
    train leaves on the hour. The user cannot calculate when the next train
    leaves from their location.
  </p>

  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>
    Where an understanding of mathematics is not a primary requirement for using
    this content use one of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reinforce numbers with non-numerical concepts, e.g., very cold, cold,
      cool, mild, warm, hot, very hot.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once it is mature you can also use personalization semantics to add
      non-numerical concepts. See [[personalization-semantics-help-1.0]].
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note that other users may find math easier to understand than long text.
  </p>
  <p>Where some math skills are essential for the content:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Move towards digital math that can be extended (not numbers in images).
    </li>
    <li>Enable highlighting of sections as they are being discussed.</li>
    <li>Link sections of numbers to extra help that can be read together.</li>
    <li>
      Enable replacing math sections with words or summaries for users who
      prefer this.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Extra support for numerical content such as:

      <ul>
        <li>sizes</li>
        <li>quantity</li>
        <li>distance</li>
        <li>time</li>
        <li>date</li>
        <li>temperature</li>
        <li>positive/negative</li>
        <li>calculations</li>
        <li>sequencing</li>
        <li>percentages.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For the above, there is a description or representation of what the
        number means as a concept.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Numerical content without extra support</li>
  </ol>
