  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need to recognize where I am in the architecture of the web site,
      application, or multi-step process, even after I get distracted.
    </p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Provide breadcrumbs, a “how I got here” button, or heading to help the user
    orientate themselves inside a site or task.
  </p>
  <p>In a multi-step process, this includes showing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the steps completed,</li>
    <li>the current step,</li>
    <li>the steps pending, and</li>
    <li>any important choices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    This pattern helps a user who loses focus, forget what they are doing or
    gets distracted reorient themselves to their current activity. Clearly
    indicating the current location and progress helps the user continue after
    they lose focus without reading a great deal of content or restarting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Providing information about the steps that need to complete a task helps
    users determine if they can successfully finish the task. This is especially
    important for users who often find processes difficult to complete.
  </p>
  <p>Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Someone with early stage dementia is interrupted in their task or
      loses focus and then cannot remember what they were doing. By seeing the
      bread crumbs they can remind themselves where they are and continue their
      task.
    </li>
    <li>
      Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then needs to
      pick up where they left off.
    </li>
    <li>
      Someone with a processing difficulty is not sure if this application has
      too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are half-way
      through they can gauge if they can cope with the entire process.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Breadcrumbs that indicate the current step in the process, important
      choices, as well as past and future steps.
    </li>
    <li>Headings that clarify exactly were the user is inside the content.</li>
    <li>
      A “how I got here” button. When the user clicks the button they receive
      orientation information about:
      <ul>
        <li>the page,</li>
        <li>how they got here, and</li>
        <li>where they are inside the content.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Completed steps and choices that are hard to find and check. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>Placing completed steps on previous pages.</li>
        <li>
          Placing selected choices in a control that hides and reveals content
          (such as an accordion).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
