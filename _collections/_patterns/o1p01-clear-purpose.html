  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>I need to know the context and purpose of the page.</p>
  </blockquote>

<section class="wtd">
  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Help the user know the purpose of the content. Use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a clear title or heading that summarizes the purpose of a page, or</li>
    <li>
      other clear signposts that have been tested by users with
      cognitive and learning disabilities.
    </li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    This helps many people, including those with impaired memory and attention
    as well as anyone who is easily distracted due to
    age-related forgetfulness</a> and <a>AD(H)D.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, someone with mild dementia is using online shopping. They get
    distracted and then when they look at the screen again they have forgotten
    what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of each page shows clearly
    <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In another example, a user with AD(H)D is looking for information in
    a video. They can tell by the video title that this video has the
    information they need.
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>Headings clarify the purpose of this specific page.</p>
  <p>
    When possible, provide information to help users understand how they got to
    the page. For example: clearly indicating breadcrumbs on main navigation,
    highlighting currently selected tab, etc.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p>
    <strong><span class="use"></span>Use:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Page headings that tell the user where they are.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    <strong><span class="avoid"></span>Avoid:</strong>
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pages without clear headings or signposts that tell the user where they
      are. For example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Page headings that do not tell the user where they are, such as a page
          heading that reads “Service not available”. The user has to remember
          what the service relates to.
        </li>
        <li>Page headings that do not clarify the steps in a form.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
