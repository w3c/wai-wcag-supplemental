  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need a login process I can use that does not rely on a lot of words (as
      someone with a severe language impairment).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

<section class="wtd">
  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Provide at least one login alternative that does not require reading or
    writing a lot of words
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    This pattern allows people with language and communication disabilities to
    login without being overwhelmed by blocks of text.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, someone with a severe language impairment using an
    <abbr title="Alternative and Augmentative Communication System"
      >AAC</abbr
    >
    device wants to send a message to their doctor. They can press the login
    with the icon they know and send a message without having to read text.
