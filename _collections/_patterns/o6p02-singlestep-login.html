  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Provide a simple, single-step alternative for logins.</p>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    A simple login allows people with impaired executive function or
    impaired memory to use applications. This is especially important for users
    who become confused or overwhelmed with multi-step processes. For example, a
    user with traumatic brain injury wishes to use a site for online
    banking. They may have put their finger on a fingerprint scanner to
    authenticate who they are. Other examples include some third party logins.
