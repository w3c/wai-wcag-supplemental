    <p>I need to be able to find features and content easily.</p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>Provide a friendly search capability. Ideally search should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>autocomplete,</li>
    <li>grouping of results when appropriate with headings for each group,</li>
    <li>ability to easily find previous searches, and</li>
    <li>spell-checking.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Having a search capability allows users to find the content they need even
    if they cannot use the site menus. A user can learn how to use search and
    reuse that skill on many sites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Menu systems and most site navigation require the user to understand the
    menu categories. Users with impaired executive function may be unable
    to identify the correct categories.
  </p>
  <p>
    In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather than
    logic. For example, most users remember that the print function is often
    found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may not be able to
    find these menu items based on recall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users with impaired short-term memory, age related forgetfulness, or
    who are easily distracted may also find navigating a site and going to many
    pages to look for content difficult. If it takes too long they may lose
    focus and forget what they are looking for.
  </p>
  <p>
    Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds appropriate or
    related content, and provides suggested auto-corrected versions of the
    search terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are many results from related topics, it helps if search results
    are presented under the appropriate heading and categories. This helps the
    user find the search results they are looking for.

  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>
    Search is less important on small sites where every page is no more than two
    clicks away from the main page.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Search with spell check or suggested terms.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Search that presents many results that are not grouped or ordered by their
      relationship to the original request.
    </li>
  </ol>
