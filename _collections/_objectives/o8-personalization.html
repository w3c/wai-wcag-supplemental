title: Support Adaptation and Personalization
summary: People with cognitive and learning disabilities often use add-ons
      or extensions as assistive technology. Sometimes, extra support requires
      minimal effort from the user via personalization that allows the user to
      select preferred options from a set of alternatives. Support
      personalization when you can. Do not disable add-ons and extensions!
      Sometimes users can receive extra support through personalization.
