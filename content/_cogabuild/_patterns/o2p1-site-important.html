  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need to find it easy to identify the content that I need, and do not
      need. Information I need to know and important information stands out, or
      is the first thing I read and does not get lost in the noise of less
      important information.
    </p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Make important tasks and features on the site stand out and easy to find.
  </p>
  <p>This includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>On the home page, calling out key tasks for the web site.</li>
    <li>
      Using call out boxes or sections of the home page for these tasks and
      features.
    </li>
    <li>Giving the most important tasks/features visual weight.</li>
    <li>
      Placing the tasks/features towards the top of the page so the user does
      not have to scroll to see them.
    </li>
    <li>
      Placing the tasks/features toward the top of the content so assistive
      technology finds them quickly.
    </li>
    <li>Providing useful headings for each key task or feature.</li>
    <li>Including key tasks at a top level of the main navigation.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    People with impaired executive function, impaired memory, and other
    cognitive and learning disabilities may have difficulty determining
    what they can do on a site. By calling out important tasks and features,
    people can more quickly determine whether the site will meet their needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, a user goes to a web site to buy tickets. He sees many reviews
    and other information but cannot see how to buy the tickets. The user leaves
    the site.
  </p>

  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>
    Make important features and tasks both visually and programmatically
    prominent. See The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG [[WCAG22]].
  </p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>Start by thinking about what are the key tasks for the user.</p>
  <p>Include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The most common tasks users want to perform.</li>
    <li>Tasks that may affect users’ health or well-being.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Usage data can normally identify the most common tasks. Focus groups and
    surveys are also useful for identifying what users want.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The most important tasks are directly on the main page and in visually
      distinct boxes. For example, important tasks on a library site might be:
      searching, signing up for a library card, locating a branch, and reserving
      a conference room.
    </li>
    <li>The most used features are near the top of the page.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Items that the team wish to promote more prominently placed than the main
      reason for users coming to the site. For example: A library web site only
      includes upcoming events on the main page. Users have to click through non
      obvious links to search for books, signing up for a library card, locating
      a branch, or reserving a conference room.
    </li>
    <li>
      Positioning information users are likely to want so they have to scroll,
      or page down, to find it.
    </li>
  </ol>
