  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need support to manage the task, such as letting me know what
      information I will need (credit card, full address, etc.) before I start.
    </p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Tell the user about all charges at the start of a transaction including
    typical values. Any conditions and terms should also be available at the
    start of the transaction in easy language.
  </p>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    Users with cognitive and learning disabilities who have trouble with
    memory, attention to detail, or reading comprehension may not be aware of
    charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a transaction task.
    Terms and conditions can be under a link, but charges must be clearly
    displayed and available in easy to understand language.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all users. Those
    with cognitive and learning disabilities will particularly benefit
    because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the charges
    would be included. They may not know to look in other places in the user
    flow, such as on the homepage, or on a designated rates page.
  </p>
  <p>
    People with impaired executive function or memory need to have all
    the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an informed
    decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the transaction is
    unclear.
  </p>
  <p>
    It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go through the
    process of making a purchase. If a person has spent hours making an online
    purchase, it is much more difficult and upsetting to find out that they
    cannot afford it. They will often blame themselves for not understanding the
    price and may experience a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting
    themselves with online, day-to-day activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, a person who has challenges with executive function may
    be trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra fees
    not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international fees, baggage
    fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only to find that they
    cannot afford it. Alternatively, sometimes they end up purchasing something
    they cannot afford. Also, even if they have completed this process in the
    past, they may not be not able to use their experience to anticipate the
    final price. The result is the user loses confidence in their ability to
    independently purchase a holiday online. They may have a debt they are
    unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help of a hired
    professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).

  <h2>Examples</h2>
  <p><span class="use"></span><strong>Use:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Clearly stated charges. Users are aware of all charges and can make an
      informed decision when they decide to purchase an item and put it in a
      shopping cart.
    </li>

    <li>
      Clearly stated of ranges of possible charges. For items with shipping
      charges that vary, list the range of shipping charges and the issues that
      change the rate, along with a link to where more details can be found. For
      example, weight and speed of shipping may impact your shipping fees which
      can be between $4 and $400 depending on location.
    </li>
    <li>There are no surprise conditions.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><span class="avoid"></span><strong>Avoid:</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Final transactions that include new charges or hidden fees, that result in
      higher-than-expected total charges.
    </li>
    <li>
      Final transactions that include conditions of purchase that are not clear
      to users from the beginning of the task.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transactions that contain charges or conditions that the user did not know
      about until they had invested a lot of effort into the sale.
    </li>
    <li>Completed transactions that surprise the user with the total cost.</li>
  </ol>
