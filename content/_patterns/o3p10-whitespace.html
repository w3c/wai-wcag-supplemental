  <h2>User Need</h2>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      I need a good use of white space, so that the chunks are clear and the
      page does not get overwhelming.
    </p>

  <h2>What to Do</h2>
  <p>
    Put white space around objects and text, including boxes, paragraph
    headings, and content, so that each section is clearly separated.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>How it Helps</h2>
  <p>
    White space (also called negative space or the background color) reduces
    clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the viewer a clear
    overview of a web page. It is used by designers to enhance text and the
    position of objects on a page.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using white space aids navigation through a page and helps people read it.
    It can help the user find important elements on a page. For those with
    cognitive and learning disabilities, white space has been shown to
    ease reading difficulties and improve understanding of content.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure users can also adjust the amount of white space around objects and
    text via a web extension or user setting. This supports the ability to
    identify important elements in the content of a web page.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>More Details</h2>
  <p>
    Use clear spacing between letters, words, sentences lines, paragraphs, and
    blocks of text.
  </p>
  <p>
    Allow for the ability to easily adjust white space around objects and text,
    including boxes, paragraph headings, and content, to a degree that suits the
    user and does not disrupt the overall integrity of a web page. Do not add so
    much white space that important content cannot be seen above the scroll.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that “white space” is a term that means the background color. It does
    not always need to be always white!
